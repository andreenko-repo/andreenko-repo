👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Anton Andreenko — a an Engineer with over 17 years of experience in industrial automation.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science, where I was first introduced to artificial intelligence and neural networks. That early spark has grown into a focused passion: I'm now dedicated to adopting AI for industrial applications — bridging the gap between operational technology (OT) and cutting-edge machine learning.

I see plenty of opportunities for AI implementation in industrial process control — including areas like:

✅ Quality control

🔐 OT security

🚨 Alarm management

🛠️ Troubleshooting

...and many others.

The rise of foundation AI models has given a huge boost to this direction, making experimentation easier and more accessible than ever before.

My current work explores:

🌐 Industrial AI for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and process optimization

🤖 Integrating AI into DCS, PLC, and SCADA environments

🔧 Developing intelligent solutions to enhance safety, efficiency, and decision-making in manufacturing and process industries
