# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Anton Andreenko — a an Engineer with over 17 years of experience in industrial automation.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science, where I was first introduced to artificial intelligence and neural networks.

I see plenty of opportunities for AI implementation in industrial process control — including areas like:

✅ Quality control

🔐 OT security

🚨 Alarm management

🛠️ Troubleshooting

...and many others.

The rise of foundation AI models has given a huge boost to this direction, making experimentation easier and more accessible than ever before.

My current work explores:

🌐 Industrial AI for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and process optimization

🤖 Integrating AI into DCS, PLC, and SCADA environments

🔧 Developing intelligent solutions to enhance safety, efficiency, and decision-making in manufacturing and process industries

# My Projects

## Shazam for Plant Equipment

A small web app that uses local Qdrant database and a camera to identify equipment and display information about it.

## Using LLMs for P&ID diagrams Q&A

A proof-of-concept application demonstrating the use of a Large Language Model (in this case, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro) to perform question-answering on Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).

A demo can be found here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/AntonAndreenko/pid_diagram_qa

## Gemini Market Analysis Report Generator

A sample application that demonstrates how to use the Google Gemini API's native Google Search tool for two distinct purposes: data collection and response grounding. These techniques allow you to minimize hallucinations in many real-world applications.

## Tennessee Eastman Process Alarms

I converted the alarms dataset into a text format to test alarm management methods using NLP AI models.

The alarm viewer can be found here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/AntonAndreenko/tep_alarms_viewer

## PID Controller Performance Evaluation and Tuning

This is a small experiment in PID performance evaluation and tuning using historical data.
