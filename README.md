# About Me

Hi, I'm Anton Andreenko — a an Engineer with over 17 years of experience.

I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science, where I was first introduced to artificial intelligence and neural networks.

I see plenty of opportunities for AI implementation in controls automation:

- Quality control

- Anomaly Detection

- Network security

- Alarm/Log management

- Troubleshooting

...and many others.

The rise of foundation AI models has given a huge boost to this direction, making experimentation easier and more accessible than ever before.

My current work explores:

AI solutions for predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and process optimization

Integrating AI into enterprise environments

Developing intelligent solutions to enhance safety, efficiency, and decision-making

# My Projects

## Studio 5000 L5X Logic Extractor

A small tool that extracts logic and variables from Studio 5000 L5X exports. Extracted informtion is much mor ecompact than original L5X file, so it can be more effciantly used for analysis using AI NLP tools.

## AI Process Operator

An experiment (inspired by Google and DeepMind SIMA-2) using a Gemini-based AI Agent to control the Tennessee Eastman Process through HMI screens, testing how AI can apply reasoning to industrial process control like a human operator.

## Shazam for Plant Equipment

A small web app that uses local Qdrant database and a camera to identify equipment and display information about it.

## Using LLMs for P&ID diagrams Q&A

A proof-of-concept application demonstrating the use of a Large Language Model (in this case, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro) to perform question-answering on Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs).

## Gemini Market Analysis Report Generator

A sample application that demonstrates how to use the Google Gemini API's native Google Search tool for two distinct purposes: data collection and response grounding. These techniques allow you to minimize hallucinations in many real-world applications.

## Tennessee Eastman Process Alarms

I converted the alarms dataset into a text format to test alarm management methods using NLP AI models.

The alarm viewer can be found here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/AntonAndreenko/tep_alarms_viewer

## PID Controller Performance Evaluation and Tuning

This is a small experiment in PID performance evaluation and tuning using historical data.
